// -asynchronously cancelable-
// allows a thread to be terminated immediately, without waiting for it to reach any specific point in its execution.
pthread_cancel(thread); // Cancel the thread asynchronously

// -synchronously cancelable-
// A thread is typically cancelable at specific points where it’s safe to stop, such as when waiting for I/O operations, sleeping, or using specific library functions like read, write, sleep, etc.

// -uncancelable-
// By setting the thread’s cancelability state to PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, you make the thread immune to any cancellation requests while this state is active
